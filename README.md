# ReadME

A simple blog including what I have learned so far in life. It may include some boring life long lessons, tech news, some nerdy things I do, interesting facts, travel logs or maybe utter bullshit! 

Stay tuned for my simple, yet useful projects/blogs. 

P.S:
A big shoutout to TaylanTatli for the theme.
